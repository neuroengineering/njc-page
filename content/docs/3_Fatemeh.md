Upcoming talk will be presented by Fatemeh Nejatbakhsh. She will talk about image processing in medical applications.  Starting with the basic concepts, she is going to explain the typical steps of a processing pipeline. After a general overview we will dive into detailed applications.  Special attention will be given to the implications of conceptually establishing a design, as it is needed in administrative positions. After addressing structural and functional imaging following this structure, Fatemeh will illustrate a concrete imaging procedure by the example of her own work.

Join our presentation & discussion for an introduction to image processing and in-depth analysis of the needed steps.
