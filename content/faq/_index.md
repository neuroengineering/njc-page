## Why a Journal Club?

Science communication is an essential aspect of scientific research. It enables scientists and  researchers to inform
each other, as well as the public, about science progress and invoke scientific, political and ethical thinking.
The general purpose of a journal club is to facilitate the review of research studies and to discuss implications of
the study in practice. In general, a journal club helps with:

- Sharing knowledge of current research
- Facilitating the learning process
- Enhancing literature critique and appraisal skills
- Encouraging interaction and dialogue with other researchers
- Encouraging research utilization, and
- Promoting team building

Neuroengineering Journal Club (NJC) is all about the above-mentioned objectives. Learning through presentations and discussions,
networking by promoting a diverse audience as well as inviting speakers outside the neuroengineering program,
from research institutes and industry.

## When and Where?

NJC is expected to have a frequency of at least once a month. The venue of the events will mostly be announced a week before the
event. However, we are likely to have most of the events near the TUM main campus.
